## Simple Web Calculator App with Vue.js

#### This Project is a simple web application which is aimed to do simple arithmetric calculations. Also in addition to that, a few scientific mathematical functions were added such as sine function, cosine function, tangent function etc. It is my first project built with vue.js and i hope to improve it soon.

### PROJECT ONE (Simple Web Calculator App with Vue.js)
#### This Project is a simple web application which is aimed to do simple arithmetric calculations. Also in addition to that, a few scientific mathematical functions were added such as sine function, cosine function, tangent function etc. It is my first project built with vue.js and i hope to improve it soon.
### NB: The special functions are specified in degrees only. Please take note. For instance sin (30) will give you a result of 0.5000 in degrees as against -0.9880 in radians.
